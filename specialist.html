        Computer scientists are, in fact, scientists. They are focused with the theory of computational applications. That means they understand the “why” behind computer programs. Using algorithms and advanced mathematics, computer scientists invent new ways to manipulate and transfer information. Computer scientists are generally concerned with software, operating systems and implementation.

        Like Neo in The Matrix, computer scientists can see and make sense of code. Computer science students will learn the fundamentals of different programming languages, linear and discrete mathematics, and software design and development. Computer scientists study the machine itself and understand how and why various computer processes operate the way they do.

        Simply put, computer scientists can talk to computers. The field is based in mathematicsäóîthe language of computers. Computer scientists understand why computers work and can create a program or operating system that does what you want it to do.

        Careers in Computer Science
        Computer science is a rapidly growing field and is expected to see large increases in employment opportunities. High salaries are generally associated with computer science careers. If you’re pursuing a computer science degree, the following career paths are open to you:

        APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: As the creative minds behind applications and programs, software developers design and build programs and applications for computers and technological devices. Angry Birds? A software developer made that. Microsoft Office? That would be software developers again. The median salary for a software developer is $98,260.
        SYSTEMS ENGINEER: Operating systems provide the foundation for computers and devices to function. Microsoft Windows, Linux, and iOS are examples of types of operating systems. Systems engineers design and create those types of systems for use in personal computers, phones, and even cars. According to PayScale, the median pay for systems engineers is $76,593.
        WEB DEVELOPER: Web developers are not graphic designers. Graphic designers create the images you see on websites; web developers program the code that makes a website function. Web developers integrate the graphics, audio, and video into the site and monitor the site’s traffic, performance, and capacity. The median salary for a web developer is $64,970.

       <div class="cis-breif"> Computer Information System</div>
        Information technology (CIS) may adopt the monikers information systems or systems administration. Essentially, IT professionals are the users of technology. IT utilizes existing operating systems, software and applications in tandem to create a larger system that solves a specific business problem. IT constructs a network from established building blocks to carry out a task, such as an automated supplies ordering service.

        Due to the nature of the work, IT professionals are more likely to interact with clients and co-workers outside of their department. They may help explain to a client how to solve technology problems or work with executives and business owners to construct a technology plan that will meet their business needs.

        IT students will study network and database design in depth, and receive an introduction to basic theory and applied mathematics. Successful IT candidates will possess strong critical thinking skills; IT professionals are tasked with resourcefully and cost-effectively applying the tools at their disposal.

        Careers in Information Technology
        At every level, from mom-and-pop shops to multinational corporations, businesses need IT. Over the next decade, career opportunities in IT are expected to grow faster than average. Depending on your level of education, a degree in IT can provide a comfortable paycheck.

        INFORMATION SECURITY ANALYST: IT security analysts work to prevent cyberattacks by monitoring their business’ network for breaches and weak spots and to create emergency plans in the event of an attack. The median annual salary for information security analysts is $90,120.
        NETWORK ARCHITECT: Sometimes called network engineers, these IT professionals design and build communication networks, such as local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and intranets. The median annual salary for network architects is $100,240.
        COMPUTER SUPPORT SPECIALIST: Support specialists provide advice and troubleshooting help to individuals and businesses that have questions about their software. The median salary for computer support specialists is $51,470.
        DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR: DBAs use software and programs to organize and store data for businesses that range from financial firms to shipping companies. The median annual salary for this role is $81,710.
        SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR: System administrators conduct the day-to-day maintenance and operation of a business’ networks, including LANs, WANs, intranets, and other communication systems. Salaries for this position vary by industry. The median annual pay for system administrators is $77,810.

            <div class="bit-breif"> Business Information Technology</div>

        Information technologists generally design, operate or maintain technology products. Not limited to employment with technology companies, information technology (IT) specialists may work with any businesses, agencies or organizations that use technology or manage large amounts of information. Regardless of the sector they work in, IT specialists usually provide similar services related to software, hardware, databases, Web resources, networks and enterprise systems.

        Duties of an information technology specialist can include network management, software development and database administration. IT specialists may also provide technical support to a business or an organization's employees and train non-technical workers on the business's information systems. Advanced information technology specialists may design systems and assess the effectiveness of technology resources already in use or new systems that are being implemented. Additionally, they will determine the practicality of changes and modification of systems.

        IT specialists will also work with external partners, including consultants, agencies and vendors, to arrive at the most appropriate system or integration of multiple systems. With information technology constantly changing, specialists must stay up-to-date on emerging technologies and the potential effectiveness of these advancements in their current system.

        Salary and Career Outlook
        According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), computer support specialists, who share many responsibilities with IT specialists, could expect an increase of 12% in job opportunities from 2014-2024. Similarly, network and systems administrators could expect an increase of 8% during the same time period. In May 2015, the BLS reported a median salary for network and computer systems administrators of $77,810 per year.
